# Welcome

The purpose of this document is to help future TWiCS leadership with regular club activities, including filling out the correct U&I forms, advertising, meeting logistics, running events, fundraising, and overall guidance.

## How to Make Changes to this Document

The easiest way to change this document is to log into this GitHub account usign the Truman TWiCS email (twics.truman@gmail.com), and click to edit the README. Another way to edit this document is to clone this repo locally, make changes, and open a pull request. There are a lot of resources on using Git/Github, but a good one to start with is [here](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).

## U&I Forms

At the beginning of the Fall, U&I will expect a number of different documents from every organization. These forms change often, and it is very common to forget to submit the right form / agreement. So, try your best but don't feel too bad if you forget something. The easiest way to know which forms to fill out is to ask U&I yourself, or to go to [this website](https://involvement.truman.edu/important-forms/) if the link still works, but as of Fall 2020 the current forms to fill out are:

- Recognition Agreement: Agreement that you will follow the rules of an official Truman organization.
- Information Form: This updated the U&I database, hosted on the U&I website, about club name, description, advisor, contact info, etc.
- Change of Information Form: This updates U&I about who the current exec members are.
- Advisor Agreement: Liability form between president and advisor.
- Roster: Names, email addresses, and student ids of students in your club. Don't worry if you don't get everyone on this list. It's not checked, and used more as evidence that people are attending your club.
- Risk Modules: Undergoing changes right now, but typically online forms that the risk manager is expected to complete.

Most of these forms you only need to fill out in the Fall. However, I think you need to fill out the Roster in the Spring, and you will need to fill out the Change of Information Form if leadership changes between Fall and Spring.

## Advertising

There are a variety of different ways to advertise. Overall, I find that's it's essential to have your semester tentatively figured out before advertising. This means having your meeting time, meeting room, and at least a short list if what you're going to do this semester decided. The list of events is especially important. It gives them a more concrete idea of what the club is about, and gives the impression that you guys are on top of it (even if you aren't!).

For brevity, I am going to put them in tiered lists based on what worked best _for us_. If you would like to try something new, or something that I previously said wasn't as effective, feel free to do so and put your findings in this document. However, if you're unsure of the best way to advertise, here were our findings:

### Most Effective

- Classroom Visits: We've asked professors to speak for ~5 minutes before class, and have targeted underclassmen courses that are less likely to know who we are. This works extremely well! Though there are few women in most CS classes (sigh), the ones who are there will take note much more than they will in an email, and it sends a message that they have a place to go if they're feeling isolated or not supported.

- Mass Emails: At the beginning of the semester, emails to all student majors and minors are the best way to inform the entire community of who we are and what we're doing. I like adding a Google Form to add their name to a mailing list

### Somewhat Effective

- Speaking at Major's Welcome: This has the benefits of a classroom visit, but it targets a smaller subset of students.

- Posters: This works especially well when placed in CS classrooms in Violet Hall, but it is extra work to design the poster, get it approved, and place it.

- Chalking: Granted, _I haven't really tried this_. I am lefthanded, and so chalk is the bane of my existence. However, I would imagine that chalking would have a similar benefit to posters, except it is less work, and would be harder to ignore. The downsides might be that it is harder to clearly read, and easier to erase. If someone tries this in the future, update the doc with how it goes! 

### Not as Effective

- Activities Fair: This is a bi-yearly tradition, and we did make a cool poster for it in 2019 that's somewhere. But, if say 100 people attend the activities fair, what are the odds that they are interested in Computer Science and identify as a woman? Maybe one or two people. It's a good way of making our name known, but very few people sign their names on the mailing list there each semester.

## Exec / Planning Meetings

I highly recommend that you meet with your exec at least once in the beginning of the semester to set up expectations and their personal responsibilities. Based on how involved your events are, you might also want to either set up weekly/bi-weekly meetings, or meet briefly before the meetings start.

I __extra__ highly recommend that you set up regular meetings with your advisor. It's a good way to stay in touch, and your advisor will often be able to provide a good perspective on your plans. Last year, I found weekly for half an hour to be a good amount of time based on what our plans are, but you might want them to be more or less frequent based on your goals.

## Normal Meetings

### Picking a Time

Doodle polls among the exec have worked well. If you're dealing with low attendance, it might also be worthwile to distribute a doodle poll to all TWiCS members.
The main thing I'd suggest is to not have your meeting time overlap with ACM, if you can help it!

### Picking a Room

Honestly, I always just go to the U&I office and fill out their room-selection form while I already have to fill out everything else. More rooms in VH are free, and a normal classroom should do just fine. We've always used VH 1140. 

## Events

Here's the real meat and potatoes of the club, and where you have a lot of freedom to do what you want. A lot of this information will be subjective, but hopefully it gives you enough ideas to get started!

### Overall

The biggest piece of advice I can give is to __plan your events the semester or break before__. It can be intimidating to have have ~15 meetings to prepare for, but having a roadmap can be extremely helpful once a busy semester starts. This roadmap can include general structure of the meetings, a few exciting things you want to do during the meetings, and any events you would want to do outside of normal meeting times. Planning this out normally just takes me a couple of hours, and it saves me tons of stress about not knowing what to do, even when plans don't entirely work out.

### Ideas
Please add to this, and move events around if you find they worked out for you / didn't work out for you!

#### General Meeting Structure

##### Works Well
- One week of more structured events (workshops, presentations, etc.) and one week of less structured events (game night, painting, etc.)
##### Doesn't Work As Well
- One week of an event, and one week of study hall. This sounds like it would work in theory, but once the semester gets stressful people find it more useful to do schoolwork on their own
- Bi-weekly meetings. Though this works when exec has less time and resources, bi-weekly meetings are easier to either forget or accidentially show up to at the wrong week

#### Meeting Events

##### Works Well
- Free food and icebreakers at the first meeting
- A game night or so, especially if the games are easy to play, easy to understand, and can accomodate many people (like Uno)
- Imposter syndrome rountable
- Resume workshops, especially around the Career Fair. Technical resumes for CS internships are unique, so it might not be helpful to ask the career center for a presenter / help
- Intern panels / bringing in companies to talk, especially around the Career Fair
- Cable making with Dr. Beck. Just tell him you'd like to do it and he can direct the conversation!
- Student presentations when students volunteer to give them

##### Doesn't Work as Well
- Asking for student presentations, especially if the TWiCS club primarily has underclassmen

##### ???
- Professor presentations / workshops. Besides cable making, I don't think we've done many of these

#### Events Outside of Normal Meetings
##### Works Well
- Bonfire! Do the bonfire or else!
- Hikes
- Escape Rooms
- Potluck

##### ???
- Bowling at Leisure World
- White elephant / gift exchange of cheap or novelty gifts
- Code obfuscation workshop. This is a workshop to write the worst code you possibly can in ~an hour. Dr. Matthews knows all about it. This went really well one semester, and not as well the next. I would say to try not to do it back to back.
- Movie night

## Fundraising

### Dues

We normally have $5 dues. If you decide to have dues, make sure you give people plenty of notice and not forget they exist (like I did).

### Selling Cables

Historically, TWiCS has sold ethernet cables during freshmen move in, and made the ethernet cables at whatever length the person buying pays for. We should pick this up again as soon as we can, because it would open the doors to a lot more exciting / expensive trips.

### Other Fundraising

We were supposed to dip our toes more into fundraising, but then the pandemic happened. Please update this when someone has done more fundaising. We also have TWiCS stickers we still need to sell.

## Mentorship

This hasn't developed enough yet for me to give meaningful advice on it, but it's definitely needed!

## Conferences / Hackathons

We haven't done this. This is my way of telling you guys to do this once you can!
